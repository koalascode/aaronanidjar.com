Before this begins, top handles and monitors are not a necessity for filmaking. They are not even needed for many people.

Top handles are becoming very popular as the cage revolution occurs. Many youtubers and BMPCC users are constantly raving about rigging out with cages, top handles, batteries, and monitors. I beleive that top handles have a purpose, but they have thier issues as well. Here are some Pros and Cons:

Pros: The biggest pros that I see with top handles are that they let you get lower shots more easily and that carrying your camera is easier. Getting lower shots can add production value to your videos since most shots are from chest/stomach level. Getting low shots, especially where the camera is very close to the ground, can add a new perspective. Carrying a camera is easier with a handle, but if you are carrying your camera for a long time I would recomend wither a [strap](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1372677-REG/peak_design_sll_bk_3_slidelite_camera_strap_black.html) or a [peak design camera clip](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1372683-REG/peak_design_cp_bk_3_capture_camera_clip_black.html/?ap=y&ap=y&smp=y&smp=y&lsft=BI%3A514&gclid=Cj0KCQjwo-aCBhC-ARIsAAkNQiszDb0uSVYhSUT21jwLahEcVulZb8QV9pEp35A7SVx53hIkMQ9yXDIaAp3vEALw_wcB) on a [hiking backpack](https://www.amazon.com/Osprey-Packs-Stratos-Backpack-Black/dp/B01IEX2TEO/ref=asc_df_B01IEX2TEO/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198072135009&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18196361402573184008&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9004233&hvtargid=pla-317875330547&psc=1). Another pro could be added stabilization, but that I have actually noticed my footage being a bit less stable with a top handle if your rig is under 5 lbs.

Cons: The most obvious con is that a top handle will make your camera setup larger and a bit heavier. This could be an issue if you are making travel films or just trying to carry less gear. Top handles also encourage shooting from lower angles. I put this as a pro, but it could be a con as well. If you are trying to film peoples facial expressions, something I wrote about in my last blog post, using a top handle can make this difficult. Finally, top handles interfere with using an EVF.

Sidenote: Something to make sure of when using a top handle is that the front and back of the camera should be balanced. If the lens is drastically heavier than the camera body, or vice versa, you will need to fight against the imbalance to be able to film. This will make your footage less stable. Also, make sure to keep one hand on the lens to get more stable footage.

Monitors are a useful tool for filming. They can help you get a clearer view of your composition, they can help you film from a lower angle if your camera's screen doesn't tilt, and they can be useful on gimbals. Monitors are in no way needed for filmaking. Built in screens are very good and so are EVFs. If you are in the market for a new monitor, here are some things to look out for:

- [ ]  If you use a log profile, make sure that your monitor has some way of inputting a LUT onto the monitor.
- [ ]  If you are in the price range of the [Atamos Ninja V](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1401565-REG/atomos_atomnjav01_ninja_v_5_4k.html/overview), look into whether its raw recording capabilities are useful for you.
- [ ]  If you film in broad daylight, make sure that the monitor is bright enough. Also, make sure for all monitors that they are color accurate.
