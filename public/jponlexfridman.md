Jordan Peterson is a highly influential, yet highly polarizing, and controversial Canadian psychologist. He was recently on the Lex Fridman podcast, and said quite a large amount of things, so here are some of my reactions and slight research on these topics.

# Food Crisis

Jordan Peterson spoke about a topic that has been on the mind of many recently, especially due to issues in Sri Lanka, a possible food crisis. As in classic Jordan Peterson fashion, he begins with a talk about tyrannical compulsion. Peterson says that radical environmentalists try to solve the climate crisis by imposing their “tyrannical” rule on others. However, Peterson mentions that he agrees more with, and trusts, figures such as Bjørn Lomborg, Matt Ridley, and Marian Tupy, who beleive that there is an environmental issue, but who claim that humans will adapt, evolve, and overcome these issues by doing “more with less”.

After a quick tangent about the absurdity of the word “environment”, Peterson brings up his analysis of a paper by Deloitte which he says that humans have to accept limits on growth and essentially become poorer. Peterson then says that when you make people in general poorer, this affects the poor the most, as species “die from the bottom up”, and that when we make people poorer, those who are barely hanging on will die.

Jordan Peterson’s main point is that when push comes to shove, environmentalists, who he says are also the same people who claim that they care about the poor, will sacrifice the poor for the planet. Peterson then takes one further level of abstraction claiming that these environmentalists just hate capitalism, and do not actually care about the environment. This take is not new for Peterson as he has previously made tweets about this during a time when he was not suspended from Twitter.

This is a point of contention for me. I have admittedly not done enough research, I haven’t read Lomberg or other’s books or articles on the subject, hence I can not comment on that. When it comes to the Delloitte article, I also do not happen to know too much about it and have not read it, all that I do know is that the r/delloitte subreddit did not seem pleased with his recent video on their company, with comments such as this one.

After reading this, I decided to read [Peterson’s article in the Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/08/15/peddlers-environmental-doom-have-shown-true-totalitarian-colours/) to gain a fuller understanding of the situation. He starts by making some slightly dubious points about the free market, saying that if Deloitte could make perfect models predicting the world then they would have all the money in the world.

This claim ignores the point of Deloitte's original piece. I doubt that Deloitte ever claimed that their model is completely accurate, nor that they have the capabilities to perfectly predict what will happen in many decades. Economists use models to try and forcast the future and create analysis based on that forcast, they don’t posses a crystal ball.

(I included this comment from r/delloitte since it’s pretty funny, but it is misleading as Deloitte is a giant company)

Jordan Peterson then plays on the Efficient Markets Hypothesis claiming that the free market can predict anything with the wisdom of the crowds, and that when we take this into account it becomes clear that people don’t think that climate change is going to affect them since it isn’t affecting stock values, but this is not very true. **Net present value calculations show that asset values beyond a time span of 30 years are irrelevant.** When you put in an asset that will pay you $10 a month for 30 years vs $10 a month forever, they have almost the same value.

As shown here, NPV of 30 years ($94.27) is almost the same as NPV of 100 years ($100). Also, due to this slight discrepancy how do we know that climate forcasts are not already baked into the prices of assets in the current market?

When you look at the piece, it becomes clear that this isn’t an argument about the climate. Jordan Peterson is actually arguing about totalitarianism and compulsion. His claims about raising the poorest people from poverty make some sense to me, a person who has barely any knowledge surrounding the topic, but when I did some research I found a [World Bank article](https://blogs.worldbank.org/climatechange/when-poverty-meets-climate-change-critical-challenge-demands-cross-cutting-solutions) that says that the poorest countries contribute the least to climate change but are affected the most. This seems to go contrary to the beliefs that Peterson talked about on Joe Rogan’s podcast once in which he said that since poorer people burn wood and coal for their power instead of cleaner alternatives like fossil fuels, lifting them to use fossil fuels would be to the benefit of both them and the environment. I concur with the fact that development in the poorest countries in the world is a necessity, but saying that it will be a positive action for the climate seems a bit farfetched, to say the least, as when people become more developed they use more energy and has a more outsized impact on the climate based on the routines of their daily lives. 

(on the topic of poverty, I may soon do some more thinking and possibly research around Margatte Wade’s appearance on Lex Fridman’s podcast, as it was deeply interesting)

Peterson then talks more about authoritarianism bringing up the Canadian trucker’s protest and the Dutch farmer's protest. At some level, I agree with the fact that trying to force people to reduce their intake of meats, dairy, and eggs is harmful, as those are the foods with some of the highest protein absorption rates on the DIAAS score, but maybe I am just rationalizing this as I enjoy eating meat and do not want that take away from me.

Finally, Peterson claiming that every environmentalist is just an anti-capitalist with tyrannical ambitions seems to be a bit exaggerated and a broad strokes assumption. He tries to characterize all of the people who are environmentalists as a sort of far left hippie, and while there is most likely overlap between leftists and climate activists, it is disingenuous to lump together such a diverse and broad array of people.

# Depression vs “Terrible Life”

This topic is interesting, mainly in the sense that it is in the wheelhouse of Jordan Peterson, a Psychology by trade. He makes the distinction between depression and having a “terrible life” and talks about his own depression.

His ideas to fight the dragon and make small changes in your life can be very helpful to some, and I feel that those are ideas that can be motivating, after all, any positive change is indeed a positive change.

The idea that people should take some form of responsibility for their lives and not succumb to nihilism is an interesting one, and the reason why I’m starting the book The Courage to Be Disliked and trying to learn more about Adlerian and other psychology.
