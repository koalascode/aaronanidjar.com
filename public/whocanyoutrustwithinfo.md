Recently, I was listening to a Lex Fridman podcast with Jordan Peterson, a topic that [I wrote an article about](https://www.aaronanidjar.com/blog/492a837d-3e70-4787-a3b7-73c2b125def0). During some of the research on that topic, I stumbled upon [a Reddit post about Lex Fridman](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/n4xqxi/am_i_the_only_one_who_cannot_stand_lex_fridman/), one which questioned his credibility, his guests, and his podcast in general. The Reddit thread was interesting, but it was mainly a critique of his expansion from CS and AI into other topics and gave me a bit of a sense of “it was better back in the older days”.

Earlier today, I was listening to a Huberman Lab podcast about alcohol, I had listened to a clip of Andrew Huberman on Lex Fridman’s podcast before and he struck me as a good informer and a sensible person, so I downloaded an episode of his podcast to listen to. After reading the Reddit post on Lex Fridman I wondered if the same concerns were being leveled against Huberman and whether the information that he had talked about was accurate. The [Reddit post about him](https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/rwqr3p/comment/hrf5ftp/) that I found criticized the advice he gave and the fact that he relies on single research papers as sources. Whether these criticisms are valid is up for debate, after all most of the people who say these things are random people on Reddit with no confirmed credentials while Huberman is an [Associate Professor of Neuroscience at Stanford University](https://profiles.stanford.edu/andrew-huberman?tab=research-and-scholarship). Although Huberman does make the distinction that his podcast is not associated with his research at Stanford, the fact that he has the position of Associate Professor and a Ph.D. shows that he has knowledge on the subject of neurobiology at least.

This topic also came into my mind after the newest Johnny Harris video, one which received quite a lot of criticism due to its oversimplification and how some of his claims are misleading. Johnny Harris has been under fire for a while now surrounding his journalistic practices and bias, with many videos disproving and refuting his claims. A great video was made which talks about the oversimplification of his last video, and Johnny Harris responded agreeing with many points.

The common string that I noticed with these cases is that the person in question has some sort of important credential (Lex Fridman - MIT researcher, Andrew Huberman - Stanford Associate Professor, Johnny Harris - Ex Vox reporter) which helps them gain initial popularity as it gives what they say credibility, but over time people begin to doubt their credibility on various topics and their credentials in general. Is this criticism justified? I am not sure, that is for you to judge.

Ultimatly, my thoughts are that in a world where there is such a large amount of information to learn about, it is at times a necessary evil to have a middleman between you and the information, this is what Andrew Huberman and Johnny Harris act as, they condense information and bring it to a digestible format. If a topic is particularly interesting to you or it is particularly meaningful, it may be best to skip the middleman and go directly into the literature on the topic. On YouTube, checking the dislike to like ratio (using an extension) and the comments on a video are usually a decent indication on the accuracy of some of the information (although YMMV depending on the channel), on podcast apps it is a bit more difficult, but checking the YT pages for the podcast can help. However when getting information online from people, including me, it is best to take things with a grain of salt when possible and do your own research when necessary.
