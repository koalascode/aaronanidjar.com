All the rage at the moment is filming with movement. Whether it is smooth handheld, gimbal shots, or sliders. Movement looks cool and it is necessary for a video to have movement, otherwise, it is just a still frame, but there are times when movement is unnecessary and even counterproductive. Still shots, either on a tripod or handheld, can show that the scene has a slower, more relaxed pace. This is especially true if the shot is a little longer, maybe 3+ seconds. But, movement can have an unwanted effect on your story if you are just using movement to have the shot look cooler. When the camera has a dolly in movement towards the subject, this adds tension to the scene. When the camera has a dolly out movement away the subject, it relieves tension. If you are shooting a person and are dollying in or out for no apparent reason, it could send the wrong message. There are many other movements that have meaning like this, which can be found in countless youtube tutorials about movement.

All being said, movement is key to filmmaking, but that movement needs to have a purpose. Purposeless movements are just distracting the viewer from the story.
