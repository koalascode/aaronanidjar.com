Larry David is the creator and writer of hit shows like Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and many others. He has a style which I have not really seen anywhere else. Let's dive into it.

First let's talk about **Seinfeld**, the easiest way to explain his style. Larry David likes to put his characters into separate stories in one show. He usually puts two characters in each story line, and there are usually 2, maybe 3 story lines per episode. He then makes the story line conflict, and then for the resolution they all intertwine to be resolved together. This leads to a feeling of completion at the end of every episode because these different conflicts have been resolved together. It also saves time since there is only one resolution. Although sometimes even Larry David, the king of comedy writing, can not end such different stories in one resolution. What is done in that situation is that 2 story lines are resolved together and the 3rd story line is resolved in the last 30s after the ad break. Ending a story after the ad break may be intentional though since it is good for advertisers.

Many times, the stories are intertwined before they resolve. This means that aspects of one story combine with aspects from another story.

Let me give an example of these phenomenons with a Seinfeld episode, The Scofflaw. If you haven't seen this episode, watch it and then come back. This episode contains three different story lines:

1. George's and Jerry's story line ( the cancer patient): George is promised a parking spot from their friend, Gary, who fakes having cancer. Gary tells George this information, but swears him to secrecy. Jerry makes George tell him about Gary's lies, but George tells Jerry that not tell Gary that he knows. Their secret.
2. Kramer's, Newman's, and the Policeman's (the scofflaw): Kramer gets involved in a policeman's hunt of the largest scofflaw in the city. Kramer finds out that Newman is the criminal, and that he has been avoiding parking tickets for years. Kramer makes Newman go to court and confess that he is the scofflaw. The punishment, he must put his car in a parking garage.
3. Elaine's and her Ex-boyfriend Jake's story line (the revenge): George accidentally tells Elaine's ex-boyfriend, Jake, that she said "hi". Jake thinks that Elaine still has feelings for him. To spite him, Elaine finds his glasses, which he is very secretive about. He will not tell anyone where he got his glasses, and when Elaine shows him that she has the same pair, he is infuriated.

Resolution for storyline 1 and 2: Gary is forced to forfeit parking space he would have given to George because of the Scofflaw, Newman. George then tells Jerry to stop pretending that he thinks Gary had cancer.

Resolution for story line 3: Elaine gives the glasses to her old boss, who is working with Jake. Jake loses control during a press conference when he sees Elaine's old boss wearing the glasses and attacks him.

Story intertwining: Elaine buys her glasses from a man on the street who has poor sight. The man then walks into the street right in front of George's car. George is forced to turn wildly to avoid the man. George crashes the car into another parked car, distracting the police officer who is about to ticket Newman. Newman gets away, but Kramer recognizes him.

In Curb your Enthusiasm, Larry David utilizes a different method for story telling by making story arcs last the entire season. In season 10 of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David makes 2 different story arcs that last the whole season and are resolved together. These are his sexual harassment lawsuit and his battle with Mocca Joe. Both of these story's culminate in his assistant, who is suing for sexual harassment, and mocha joe starting a relationship. Both of them sue Larry David and with the settlement money they buy a house next to Larry David's to spite him.
